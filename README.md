**Configuration checks:** [![Build Status](https://build.lounge.rocks/api/badges/9/status.svg)](https://build.lounge.rocks/repos/9)

All Module options are documeted at: https://pinpox.github.io/nixos/

This repository includes all configurations for my NixOS machines. Feel free to
use parts of it as you please, but keep it mind it is intended mostly for
personal use. I've written posts about certain aspects of this setup on my
[personal blog](https://pablo.tools/posts).

# Initial Setup

The structure of this repository is meant to allow easy manual deployment.
Individual hosts are defined in `/machines/<hostname>` and will import re-usable
parts of the configuration as needed.

Deployment and management is done with [clan](https://clan.lol).
Secrets are stored in [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

**TL;DR** To use a host configuration on a fresh install, make sure that:

- The hostname is set correctly (`hostname <machine name>`)
- You are connected to the internet and have access rights to the repository
- Pass has the necessary secrets for the machine
- The machine's config is up-to-date

Then backup the generated `hardware-configuration.nix` file:

```bash
# Overwrite hardware-configuration.nix file with the generated one
cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix \
   ./machines/$(hostname)/hardware-configuration.nix

# Commit and push the new file
git commit -am"Add hardware-configuration for $(hostname)" && git push
```

> TODO: update

It is also possible to build on the system itself when logged in, e.g. to get
additional debug information.

```bash
cd /var/src/machine-config
sudo nixos-rebuild --flake ".#kartoffel" switch
```

# Current Hosts

| Configuration                       | Type      | Location    | VPN IP         | Description                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [kartoffel](./machines/kartoffel)   | Desktop   | local       | `192.168.7.3`  | Desktop                      |
| [limette](./machines/limette)       | Desktop   | local       | `192.168.7.2`  | Notebook                     |
| [birne](./machines/birne)           | Server    | local       | `192.168.7.4`  | Local NAS                    |
| [porree](./machines/porree)         | Server    | netcup.de   | `192.168.7.1`  | Server for pablo.tools       |
| [kfbox](./machines/kfbox)           | Server    | netcup.de   | `192.168.7.5`  | Server for 0cx.de            |

The services running on each host are documented in the host-specific
`README.md` files.

# Deployment


Deployment is done via [clan CLI](https://clan.lol) provided via the flake's
default nix shell. I use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to automatically start it
when entering the repository's directory. Run `direnv allow` on the first time,
after that, deployment can be done via:

```sh
clan machines update <hostname>
```
# Contributing?

While contributions don't make much sense for a personal configuration repository,
I'm always happy to get hints, tips and constructive criticism. If you find something 
that could be done in a better way, please let me know!
